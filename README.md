# Algorithmic-Toolbox-Assignment-Solutions

These are my own solutions for the weekly assignments of Algorithmic Toolbox course by University of California San Diego that i took via Coursera.

Solutions are written in **C++**

(week4 assignment6 is excluded)

(i got 97% overall grade from assignments)



##### Greedy algorithm didn't work correctly all the time. So i did solve some of them by using aspects of dynamic programming, and memoization.

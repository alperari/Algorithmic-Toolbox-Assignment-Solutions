# Algorithmic-Toolbox-Assignment-Solutions

These are my own solutions for the weekly assignments of Algorithmic Toolbox course by University of California San Diego that i took via Coursera.

Solutions are written in **C++**

(week4 assignment6 is excluded)

(i got 97% overall grade from assignments)

> **Greedy algorithm** didn't work correctly all the time. So i did solve some of them by using aspects of **dynamic programming, and memoization**. 

This way i was able to reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(nlogn).




Please refer to corresponding PDF's under each folder. There are descriptions for problems.
